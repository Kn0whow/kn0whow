## Introduction to me

Welcome to my blog! I am a current sysadmin working in an internal IT department for a large company. I have been a sysadmin now for just over 3 years, and have worked in IT for just over 5 years in total after graduating university. My first IT job was at an MSP, starting in 1st line support, then moving up to 2nd line before eventually becoming a sysadmin. I knew since the start of university that I wanted to work in internal IT for a company, but I definitely am glad I worked at an MSP as I learned so much there in such a short space of time.

## Focuses in work

My main focuses in work currently are infrastructure (Server maintenance, Networking), and cybersecurity. There are always so many projects to take on and new things to learn.

## Purpose of the blog

I've wanted to start a blog for a while, to have a place to document problems and their solutions, or encounters I have in the IT industry. It is mainly just a place for me to monitor my own progression, but the thought of even one person finding something on here which helps them would be great!

I have to credit the great [Jack Rhysider](https://www.twitter.com/JackRhysider) for being the one to inspire me to finally start the blog.

## Blog behind the scenes

This blog is built using Jekyll, and is hosted on Github pages. The theme is [Minimal Mistakes by Michael Rose](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).
